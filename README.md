## Project Specs

For this solo challenge I had to create a React application that allows users to see a list of articles and a “detailed” view for each article in 8 hours. The goal of this [project](https://mod4.turing.edu/projects/take_home/take_home_fe) was to demonstrate the understanding of:

- React fundamentals
- Create multi page UX using React Router
- Frontend best practices

## Setup

- In your terminal, clone the repo
- `https://github.com/camianderson/news-corner`
- Make a new directory and cd into it
- Install NPM packages
- `npm install`
- Do NOT run `npm audit fix --force`
- Then type `npm start` . This runs the app in the development mode.
- Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.
- Enjoy using News Corner!
- NOTE: Make sure that you type Control + C in your terminal when you are done using the application. This ensure the server will stop running before your close your Terminal.
- Start the server to see the local site `npm start`

- Make sure to check out NY Times API [here](https://mod4.turing.edu/projects/take_home/take_home_fe#:~:text=New%20York%20Times%20API%20Top%20Stories%20API)

## Future Features

- Create favorites component and logic
- Create a serch bar so users can search for specific news
